{"prompt": "Sample page for gpt", "completion": "<p>If your company is considering entering a new market or needs to research product ideas, why not start with online reviews from real users? This was the very idea that <a href=\"http://www.mwsug.org/proceedings/2018/SB/MWSUG-2018-SB-89.pdf\">drove a major Amazon case study</a> on pricing by a young analyst team.</p><p>They wanted to understand the best speakers available to purchase at the $150 price point. They theorized that if you&rsquo;re going to develop and market a new product, it is useful to understand what features are most valued. What a great business use case and a reasonable example of analytics!</p><p>The team extracted data for five speakers based on popular brands that Amazon customers had reviewed. The data contained consumer ranking, price, and all customer reviews.</p><p>This data was a mix of structured data (ratings, price) and unstructured data (review text).</p><p>Using the customer rating, these junior data scientists wanted to learn which product characteristics influenced scores. The following figure shows the products with the final text topic extraction analysis.</p>"}
{"prompt": "THIRD SAMPLE", "completion": "<p>Just as customers share information when they tweet, your competitors expose information about themselves when they report to public databases. There are several instances where the US government has mandated information. Subsequently, the data is published and made available to all.</p><p>Zencos worked with a medical device manufacturer using FDA reports as a source. This data set contains several hundred thousand medical device reports of suspected device-associated deaths, acute injuries, and malfunctions. Our team was able to use the database to match the companies to their products. Then we used the text fields to understand the main issues with some of the company&rsquo;s devices. Some detective work was required, but the result was fruitful.</p>"}
{"prompt": "Another sample", "completion": "<p>Across all industries, business users are learning the value of their raw text. By mining this data, they can save operational costs, uncover relationships previously not available, and gain insights into future trends.</p><p>Is it hard to believe that 80 percent of business data is in the form of text?</p><p>Examples include call center transcripts, online reviews, customer surveys, and other text documents. This untapped text data is a gold mine waiting to be discovered. Text mining and analytics turn these untapped data sources from words to actions. However, to do so, each company needs to have the skillsets, infrastructure, and analytic mindset to adopt these cutting edge technologies. To better assess your ability to embrace text mining solutions, Zencos has developed a self-evaluation analytics checklist to assess your companies readiness to become analytically driven.</p>"}
